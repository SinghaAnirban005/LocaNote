Understanding Redis: A Fast, In-Memory Data Store
Redis (which stands for Remote DIctionary Server) is an open-source, in-memory data structure store, used most often as a cache, a database, and a message broker. Unlike traditional disk-based databases, Redis stores its dataset primarily in a server's main memory (RAM). This fundamental design choice is the secret behind its legendary speed, offering sub-millisecond latency for both read and write operations. It provides a key-value store model, where a unique key is associated with a value, but the "value" itself can be one of several sophisticated data structures, making it far more versatile than a simple key-value database.
